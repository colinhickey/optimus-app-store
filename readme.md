Some apps also available for Neuralink

To do list:
add filters to the page

style the page so its less boring, nice glows, sharper layout

disclaimer, made for fun in footer

redo some of the images with the microsoft prompt improver, it worked well!

confetti when click send to optimus

pagetakeover with hypnosis animation when sent to neuralink.
(that will be fun, I want to work on it now!)

testing, people don't scroll. make scroll down arrow or support clicks to animate.
